Run Locally
To run this project on your local system:

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Kumarswamy-palakuri/react-week-7-day-2.git
cd TDD-TODO

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start

# Run test cases (Jest + React Testing Library)
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

=======
# React Week 7 Day 2
# Contact Management App (React + Node.js)

This is a full-stack contact management application built with a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend API. It allows users to register, log in, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their contacts.

## Features

-   **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
-   **Contact Management**: A simple and intuitive interface to manage personal contacts.
-   **CRUD Functionality**: Full capabilities to create, view, edit, and delete contacts.
-   **Responsive UI**: A user-friendly interface built with Material-UI.
-   **RESTful API**: A well-structured backend API to handle all data operations.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend (Client)

-   **Framework**: React.js
-   **UI Library**: Material-UI
-   **Routing**: React Router (`react-router-dom`)
-   **HTTP Client**: Axios
-   **Build Tool**: Create React App (`react-scripts`)

### Backend (Server)

-   **Framework**: Express.js
-   **Runtime**: Node.js
-   **Authentication**: JSON Web Token (`jsonwebtoken`)
-   **Password Hashing**: BcryptJS (`bcryptjs`)
-   **Middleware**: CORS

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

-   `client/`: Contains the React frontend application.
-   `server/`: Contains the Node.js/Express backend API.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
-   npm (or yarn)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Kumarswamy-palakuri/react-week-7-day-2.git
    cd react-week-7-day-2
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend Server:**
    -   Navigate to the server directory:
        ```
        cd server
        ```
    -   Install dependencies:
        ```
        npm install
        ```
    -   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add a secret key for JWT:
        ```
        JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_here
        ```
    -   Start the development server:
        ```
        npm run dev
        ```
    The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in your code).

3.  **Set up the Frontend Client:**
    -   Open a new terminal window and navigate to the client directory from the project root:
        ```
        cd client
        ```
    -   Install dependencies:
        ```
        npm install
        ```
    -   Start the React development server:
        ```
        npm start
        ```
    The client will be running on `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your browser to use the application.

## Available Scripts

### Backend (`/server`)

-   `npm start`: Starts the server in production mode using `node`.
-   `npm run dev`: Starts the server in development mode using `nodemon`, which automatically restarts the server on file changes.

### Frontend (`/client`)

-   `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
-   `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
-   `npm run eject`: Ejects the app from Create React App's managed configuration.
